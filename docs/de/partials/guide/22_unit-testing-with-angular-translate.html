<p>AngularJS is built with testability in mind. And we love that. This is why we
unit tested angular-translate from the ground up. However, when building AngularJS
applications with i18n support using angular-translate, testing your application
could get a bit tricky. This guide shows you how to get around common issues when
writing unit tests for your application that uses angular-translate.</p>
<h3 id="unit-testing-with-angular-translate_whats-the-problem">What&#39;s the problem?</h3>
<p>From our experience during the time of developing angular-translate, there came only
one issue up when it comes to testing. Imagine the following scenario: You build an
app that not only uses angular-translate, but also makes use of an asynchronous
loader (which is very common). So let&#39;s say our app configuration looks like this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
app.config(function ($translateProvider) {
  $translateProvider
    .useStaticFilesLoader({
      prefix: 'locale-',
      suffix: '.json'
    })
    .preferredLanguage('en');
});
</pre>
<p>In this configuration we use the static files loader to load our i18n data from a
remote endpoint. We also tell angular-translate that our preferred language is <code>en</code>.
Pretty straight forward.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s say we have a controller, which uses the <code>$translate</code> service to switch
the language at runtime (which is also <em>very</em> common):</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
app.controller('LanguageController', function ($scope, $translate) {
  $scope.switchLanguage = function (locale) {
    $translate.use(locale);
  });
});
</pre>
<p>Okay great. That&#39;s it. Let&#39;s go through our minds and think about what happens
when we run this app. Here is the process step by step:</p>
<ul>
<li>we register a asynchronous loader</li>
<li>we define our preferred language</li>
<li><code>$translate</code> service is instantiated the first time it gets injected</li>
<li>angular-translate notices that there&#39;s no language locally available</li>
<li>it looks if there&#39;s a registered asynchronous loader</li>
<li>the asynchronous loader is called with the preferred language locale</li>
<li>the translation data is loaded and ready to be used</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s important to understand how angular-translate handles the flow to get an
idea what issues it can cause. So, going through this steps, there&#39;s one thing
that has a siginificant impact. When an asynchronous loader is registered and
there&#39;s no translation table cached yet, angular-translate calls the registered
loader <strong>implicitly</strong>. Why can this cause issues when unit testing your
application?</p>
<p>Well, to understand that, we have to take a look how we would right unit tests with
for example, Jasmine. We start with a <code>describe()</code> block and load our angular app
for each spec:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
describe('myApp', function () {

  beforeEach(module('myApp'));

});
</pre>
<p>Okay, so what this does, it makes sure that on every following spec our app module
is instantiated. Next, we set up our <code>LanguageController</code> with a mocked scope like
this:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
describe('myApp', function () {

  beforeEach(module('myApp'));

  var LanguageCtrl, scope;

  beforeEach(inject(function ($controller, $rootScope) {
    scope = $rootScope.$new();

    LanguageCtrl = $controller('LanguageCtrl', {
      $scope: scope
    });
  }));

  it('should do something', function () {

  });
});
</pre>
<p>When we run this test, we&#39;ll get the following error:</p>
<pre><code>Error: Unexpected request: GET locale-en.json
</code></pre><p>So why do we get this error? So problem here is, that angular-translate calls the
asynchronous loader implicitly. Which means, when <code>$translate</code> service is instantiated
through DI, there&#39;s a XHR happening without us doing anything about it.</p>
<p>When writing tests and there are XHRs, one has to explicitly say that one expects
a XHR in a certain spec. This is part of proper testing. In other words,
when we explicitly say that there&#39;s a XHR happening, this error shouldn&#39;t occur,
right?</p>
<p>So let&#39;s try to get around this error by injecting the <code>$httpBackend</code> service to
expect XHRs and mock responses:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
describe('myApp', function () {

  beforeEach(module('myApp'));

  var LanguageCtrl, scope, $httpBackend;

  beforeEach(inject(function ($controller, $rootScope, _$httpBackend_) {
    scope = $rootScope.$new();
    $httpBackend = _$httpBackend_;

    LanguageCtrl = $controller('LanguageCtrl', {
      $scope: scope
    });
  }));

  it('should do something', function () {
    $httpBackend.expectGET('locale-en.json');

    // test code goes here
  });
});
</pre>
<p>It turns out, that this doesn&#39;t work either, because at the time when <code>expectGET()</code>
is called, the asynchronous loader has already been executed. Hell, is there no
way to get around this issue?</p>
<h3 id="unit-testing-with-angular-translate_the-solution">The solution</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, this issue is caused by the design of angular-translate. To get
around these errors, all we can do is to overwrite our module configuration in
our test suite, that it <strong>doesn&#39;t</strong> use asynchronous loader at all. When there&#39;s
no asynchronous loader, there&#39;s no XHR and therefore no error.</p>
<p>So how do we overwrite our module configuration at runtime for our test suite?
When instantiating an angular module, we can always apply a inline function which
is executed as configuration function. This configuration function can be used
to overwrite the modules configuration since we have access to all providers.</p>
<p>Using the <code>$provide</code> provider, we can build a custom loader factory, which should
then be used instead of the static files loader.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
beforeEach(module('myApp', function ($provide, $translateProvider) {

  $provide.factory('customLoader', function () {
    // loader logic goes here
  });

  $translateProvider.useLoader('customLoader');

}));
</pre>
<p>This code is executed <strong>before</strong> each spec, so in other words, we overwrite the used
loader just for the test specs. Now all we have to do, is to build a loader that doesn&#39;t
make a XHR:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
beforeEach(module('myApp', function ($provide, $translateProvider) {

  $provide.factory('customLoader', function ($q) {
    return function () {
      var deferred = $q.defer();
      deferred.resolve({});
      return deferred.promise;
    };
  });

  $translateProvider.useLoader('customLoader');

}));
</pre>
<p>That&#39;s it! Another option would be to always provide the preferred language of your
app as static JSON:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
beforeEach(module('myApp', function ($translateProvider) {

  $translateProvider.translations('en', {});
}));
</pre>
</div></div>
