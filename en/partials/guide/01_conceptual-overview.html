<p>The following figure shows in a little abstract way how angular-translate is
structured and how the different components it provides, are actually connected.</p>
<p><img class="pull-right" style="padding-left: 3em;" src="img/guide/conceptual_overview.png"></p>
<h3 id="conceptual-overview_the-nitty-gritty">The nitty-gritty</h3>
<p>As you can see, angular-translate provides a directive and a filter as components
you can use to translate your apps content. The directive appears on top of the
filter component because it makes use of it internally.</p>
<p>In the next layer it gets a bit more interesting. Both, the directive and the
filter use the <code>$translate</code> service. Which means, when translating contents of
your app with a directive, you&#39;re actually doing it with the filter, which actually
does it with the service. This also means that you can not only translate your
contents in the view layer in a declarative way, but also (of course only if
needed) in a business logic layer like a controller or another service.</p>
<p>Within the <code>$translate</code> service you can see some sub components which are used
by it to translate your contents. We&#39;ll get into this in a more detail later
but nevertheless its good to get an overview of what&#39;s actually happening there.</p>
<h3 id="conceptual-overview_interpolators">Interpolators</h3>
<p>The right box represents possible interpolation services <code>$translate</code> service uses
to interpolate your translations against variable values you might want to use
there. If you don&#39;t understand what this means, no worries. You&#39;ll learn everything
you need to know about interpolators later. However, interpolation services are
decoupled from the main core, which means, you can install them as extra packages.
There&#39;s a default interpolation service which ships with angular-translate built-in.</p>
<p>Interpolators influence the syntax you have to use within your translations. The
default interpolation service uses Angular&#39;s core interpolation service, so if
you familiar with it, you don&#39;t have to learn anything new. The <strong>MessageFormat</strong>
interpolation service uses a different syntax, but more on that later.</p>
<h3 id="conceptual-overview_missing-translation-handlers">Missing translation handlers</h3>
<p>The left box shows provided missing translation handlers. These get executed when
<code>$translate</code> service tries to translate a key which doesn&#39;t exist. You
don&#39;t have to use any handler, but if you want to, angular-translate comes with
a logging service you can install as an extension. In addition to that, you can also
implement your own handler and use it.</p>
<h3 id="conceptual-overview_asynchronous-loader">Asynchronous loader</h3>
<p>Of course you want to be able to load your translation data asynchronously to
speed up your apps performance. angular-translate supports the use of so called
asynchronous loaders, which are very easy to use. There are two asynchronous
loaders, <code>urlLoader</code> and <code>staticFilesLoader</code>. Both of them solves a specific
situation when it comes to asynchonous loading of translation data. Anyways, of
course you can build your own custom loaders and use them if you want to.</p>
<h3 id="conceptual-overview_storage">Storage</h3>
<p>Since its pretty common that an app, which provides multi-language support, should
remember the language a user has chosen during runtime, angular-translate gives
you a way to use any kind of storage. It checks if it should rely on any storage and if so it tries to find a specific key - value pair within the configured storage
to determine which language actually should be loaded.</p>
<p>angular-translate comes with support for localStorage and cookieStorage. You can
easily install extension packages to make use of them.</p>
<p>Now you got a little overview on how angular-translate is structured, which kind
of features it provides and how the components are connected. In the next chapter
you&#39;ll learn how to start with angular-translate.</p>
